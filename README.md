*A medium-fidelity sample storyboard for the JFT SDP Coding Coach MVP release — not a pixel-perfect specification.*
*Built with Claude Code on the [SDP Design System v1.2](https://github.com/openedx/paragon) (Paragon / Open edX) with WGU FY26 brand tokens.*

## Overview

This storyboard is a medium-fidelity visual sample for the **JFT Skills Development Platform (SDP) MVP** -- an AI-powered Python coding coach for WGU students. It covers all four MVP user scenarios defined in the JFT SDP MVP Scenario Catalog v1.1.

The prototype consists of three self-contained HTML files that work offline, require no build step, and render in any modern browser. These illustrate roughly what the MVP could look like on a desktop browser -- they are **not** pixel-perfect specifications to be duplicated exactly. This prototype was built with Claude Code for rapid visualization, has not been formally audited for accessibility, and has not been tested for mobile responsiveness. Developers should deploy something that looks approximately like this using the Cicada v1.1 codebase; the first release from JFT is an MVP and will be iterated on several times during the contract duration.

## Scenarios

| Scenario | Flow | Screens | Description |
|:---------|:-----|:-------:|:------------|
| **SC-MVP-01** | Basic | 8 | First launch of the Coding Coach. New student with no Python knowledge completes diagnostic, views progress map, begins first coaching task, saves session. |
| **SC-MVP-02** | Advanced | 11 | Progressive coaching with targeted feedback. Student with partial Python knowledge completes diagnostic, receives foundational coaching, encounters incorrect answer with specific error feedback, verifies gap resolution, advances difficulty. |
| **SC-MVP-03** | Professional | 9 | Experienced developer fast-tracks through the coaching baseline. Diagnostic demonstrates mastery across all sub-sections. One verification task required for Functions & Modular Programming. |
| **SC-MVP-04** | Returning | 6 | Student returns after a multi-week break. Prior progress preserved. Re-assessment verifies retention before resuming coaching at prior difficulty level. |

## Design System

The storyboard implements the **SDP Design System v1.2**, which is a brand theme layer on top of [Paragon](https://github.com/openedx/paragon) (Open edX's open-source design system).

| Layer | Purpose |
|:------|:--------|
| **Paragon** | Component structure, accessibility, base CSS (`@openedx/paragon`) |
| **WGU Brand Tokens** | Color, typography, spacing overrides (`--pgn-*` CSS custom properties) |
| **SDP Product** | Page composition, content structure, learning interactions |

### Color Palette (WGU FY26 — Authoritative)

| Token | Hex | Role |
|:------|:----|:-----|
| Deep Navy | `#001730` | Primary dark background, navbar, headers |
| Dark Navy | `#002855` | Deep accent, logo gradient |
| Bright Blue | `#0070F0` | Primary actions, CTAs, links |
| Sky Blue | `#46B1EF` | Secondary blue, accents, progress |
| Ice Blue | `#EEF6F9` | Light surface backgrounds |
| Accent Red | `#C13232` | Error states, emphasis |
| Amber | `#FBAE40` | Warnings, section accents |

All colors aligned to the WGU FY26 Design System Specification. Where FY26 and SDP Figma tokens conflict, FY26 values take precedence.

### Typography

- **Headings:** Sora Bold (H1: 40px, H2: 32px, H3: 28px, H4: 24px, H5: 20px)
- **Body:** Lato Regular 16px / 1.5 line-height
- **Type scale:** 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 24, 28, 32, 40, 48px (strict — no off-scale sizes)
- **Code blocks:** Lato 14px — light mode: white background with SDP palette syntax colors; dark mode: `#0d1117` background with high-contrast syntax colors

### Spacing

All padding, margin, and gap values follow an **8-point grid** (multiples of 8px: 8, 16, 24, 32, 40, 48px).

## Features

- **34 interactive screens** across 4 self-contained scenario flows
- **zyBooks landing page** — every scenario starts from a realistic zyBooks course page with "Coding Coach" CTA button positioned next to the Competencies section
- **Dark mode toggle** (moon/sun icon in header) with localStorage persistence
- **Light-mode-aware code blocks** — white background with SDP palette syntax highlighting in light mode, dark theme in dark mode
- **Official WGU Corporation logos** embedded as base64 PNG
- **Keyboard navigation** (arrow keys between screens)
- **Admin bar** with 3-column layout: scenario ID, description, numbered screen buttons
- **Presentation pages** — scrollable scenario catalogs with annotated screenshots (light and dark variants)
- **Basic accessibility patterns** applied (semantic HTML, ARIA landmarks, heading hierarchy) but no formal WCAG audit has been performed
- **FY26 brand compliance** — all colors, typography, and spacing validated against the WGU FY26 Design System Specification
- **Fully offline** -- self-contained HTML files, no external dependencies beyond Google Fonts
- **Paragon-compatible CSS** class names (`--pgn-*` tokens, `.btn-primary`, `.pgn__card`, etc.)

## Changelog (v3.1)

Changes applied since v3.0 (30 Mar 2026):

- **zyBooks landing page** — replaced mock WGU Student Portal LMS page (Screen 01) across all four scenarios with a realistic zyBooks course page; "Coding Coach" CTA button placed next to the Competencies section as the new entry point
- **Sequential screen numbering** — renumbered all 34 screens sequentially (01–08 SC-MVP-01, 09–19 SC-MVP-02, 20–28 SC-MVP-03, 29–34 SC-MVP-04); admin bar now displays true screen numbers instead of restarting at 01 per scenario
- **Presentation text sync** — fully aligned presentation.html and presentation_dark.html narrative text, Notes for JFT, and Document Control with the v1.2 Scenario Catalog (07 Apr 2026), including expanded LRPS descriptions per WGU LRPS team review
- **Design system audit** — 271 fixes across index.html and presentation.html covering WCAG 2.2 AA compliance, FY26 color palette alignment, typography scale enforcement, and 8-point spacing grid
- **FY26 palette reconciliation** — `--pgn-*` tokens updated from SDP Figma values to FY26 authoritative values (`#001730`, `#0070F0`, `#46B1EF`)
- **Light-mode code blocks** — white background with SDP palette syntax highlighting; dark mode retains `#0d1117` theme
- **Screen-footer removal** — removed "Screen X of Y" navigation bar from all screens
- **Heading focus outline fix** — suppressed `:focus-visible` outline on headings after programmatic focus
- **Dark mode presentation** — added `presentation_dark.html` with all 34 dark-theme screenshots
- **WCAG improvements** — skip navigation links, `<main>` landmark, contentinfo footer, heading hierarchy fixes, table scope attributes, aria-labels, focus indicators, responsive breakpoints, touch target sizing, contrast ratio fixes
- **Screenshot recapture** — all 68 screenshots (34 light + 34 dark) recaptured at 1440×900 with sequential filenames matching new screen IDs

## For Developers

This storyboard is a **medium-fidelity sample**, not production code or a pixel-perfect specification. It was built with Claude Code for rapid visualization and is meant to illustrate the general look and feel of the MVP on a desktop browser. Do not attempt to replicate it exactly -- use it as a rough guide for the intended user experience. When implementing:

1. Install Paragon: `npm install @openedx/paragon`
2. Apply WGU brand tokens via the brand package override mechanism
3. Use Paragon React components -- do not rebuild them
4. The CSS custom properties in this file (`--pgn-*`) map directly to the Paragon token schema
5. The screen layouts, component patterns, and interaction flows shown here illustrate the general direction -- adapt them as needed for the production implementation
