# Changelog

All notable changes to the JFT SDP storyboard. Format loosely follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/).

The repo's storyboard version (`Storyboard vN.M`) tracks the visual prototype, not the underlying SDP product version that JFT is building. The SDP product follows the user scenario catalog versions (v1.2 MVP, v1.3 Additional, etc.).

## v4.16 — 08 May 2026 — Ninth overboard sweep (lrps/README prose drift + JS comments + 5-day FERPA SLA + 47 operators)

Pass 15 (post-v4.15 independent audit) found **1 Material + 4 Borderline** items. v4.16 closes the Material + 3 of 4 Borderline (the 4th — `4-hour RTO` — was Pass 15's "noted but not flagged" tail; left as-is, parallel to kept "99.95% / 99.97% uptime"). **No screens removed** (still 77); all in-place text edits.

### Trimmed — `lrps/README.md` prose paragraph "three live SDP rows" survived v4.15

v4.15 swept the count table (lines 26-27) but missed the prose paragraph at line 20 saying "three live SDP rows (Tenant Admin, Instructor, Super Admin)" — same enumeration error v4.15 fixed elsewhere. Updated to "four live SDP rows (Student, Tenant Admin, Instructor, Super Admin)."

### Trimmed — JS code comments in `lrps/index.html` (consistency with v4.15)

Two non-user-visible JS comments still said "three" — the agent flagged at borderline confidence. Cleaned for consistency:
- Line 1113: "Make the three live SDP rows launch their portals" → "Make the four live SDP rows launch their portals"
- Line 1123: "Theme toggle (matches the three SDP portals)" → "Theme toggle (matches the four SDP portals)"

### Trimmed — fabricated "5-day SLA for correction requests" (FERPA control table)

`super_admin/index.html:1300` claimed a 5-day SLA for FERPA correction requests. 34 CFR §99.10's regulatory window is 45 days; the 5-day claim was a fabricated JFT-side internal commitment with no SOW/catalog grounding. Same class as v4.10's "7 years (FERPA default)" trim. Softened to "correction requests handled per institutional policy (within the 45-day regulatory window)" — preserves the regulatory anchor (45 days), drops the invented JFT-side specific.

### Trimmed — fabricated "47 JFT + WGU operators" (FERPA training gauge)

`super_admin/index.html:1262` sub-text said "All 47 JFT + WGU operators current." 47 is invented headcount with no SOW/catalog grounding. Same class as v4.14's "1,247 sessions" trim. Softened to "All operators current per institutional policy."

### Verification

- `git diff --stat student/index.html` returns **0 lines** (preservation directive intact through 13 consecutive releases)
- `grep -i "three live SDP\|three SDP portals"` in deliverable → 0 hits (CHANGELOG meta-context allowed)
- `grep "5-day SLA\|All 47"` in deliverable → 0 hits
- All 4 Pass 15 findings (1 Material + 3 Borderline) verified clean
- The 4th Pass 15 borderline item ("4-hour RTO" specific) explicitly left as-is — agent rated borderline-not-flagged; matches the contract-grounded pattern of "99.95% / 99.97% uptime" (specific SLA telemetry display)
- Forbidden-term sweep clean

### Numbers

| | v4.15 | v4.16 |
|---|---|---|
| Total storyboard screens | 77 | **77** (no removals) |
| `three live SDP` mentions | 3 | **0** |
| `5-day SLA` fabricated specific | 1 | **0** |

## v4.15 — 08 May 2026 — Eighth overboard sweep (catalog/README leakage from v4.14 + 3-vs-4 LRPS row drift + {section_id} URL)

Pass 14 (post-v4.14 independent audit) found **4 items** — three Material + one Borderline. Three of them are catalog/README sites that mirrored v4.14's storyboard fixes; the fourth is a 3-vs-4 internal contradiction that has been latent since the student row was added to LRPS as a live entry. v4.15 closes all 4. **No screens removed** (still 77); all in-place text edits.

### Trimmed — `WGU policies 8.2 and 8.4` survived in catalog narratives + super_admin README

v4.14 trimmed the fabricated `WGU Policy 8.4` and `WGU Policy 8.2` citations from `super_admin/index.html` (FERPA control table) but missed three downstream sites mirroring the same SC-ADD-04 step-6 description:

- `presentation.html:709` SC-ADD-04 step 6 narrative
- `presentation_dark.html:709` (same)
- `super_admin/README.md:19` SC-ADD-04 row

All three softened to "generic WGU institutional policies (data breach drill, staff FERPA training)" — same trim rationale as v4.14.

### Trimmed — "Dashboard home with section cards" catalog step title

`presentation.html:653` + `presentation_dark.html:653` SC-ADD-03 step 2 step title still said "section cards" even though the step body and the storyboard itself were corrected to "course" framing. The CSS class `.section-card` is internal styling (not user-visible); only the step title was the leakage. Trimmed to "Dashboard home with course cards."

### Trimmed — "3 live SDP rows" stale count (LRPS actually shows 4)

LRPS landing page (`lrps/index.html` line 727) shows "4 Live SDP rows" and line 736 explicitly enumerates "Student, Tenant Admin, Instructor, Super Admin" as the four live rows. But three docs still claimed 3:

- `index.html:455` LRPS portal-card scenario tag: "3 live SDP rows" → "4 live SDP rows"
- `README.md:41` Surfaces table LRPS row: "(3 live SDP rows, 17 illustrative)" → "(4 live SDP rows + illustrative filler)"
- `README.md:187` LRPS scope bullet: "3 live SDP rows (Tenant Admin, Instructor, Super Admin)" → "4 live SDP rows (Student, Tenant Admin, Instructor, Super Admin)"
- `lrps/README.md:26-27` table: count 3 → 4 with persona enumeration

### Trimmed — `{section_id}` URL placeholder in LRPS instructor row

`lrps/index.html:935` had `lrps.wgu.edu/provision/sdp/instructor/{section_id}` as the user-visible URL template. The other three live rows use `?role=student` / `{tenant_id}` / `?mfa=required` — none reference sections. Per the rolling-enrollment rule (README line 202), "section" framing is forbidden in user-facing copy; this URL fragment is user-visible in the LRPS provider table. Replaced with `{course_id}` to match the rolling-enrollment model.

### Verification

- `git diff --stat student/index.html` returns **0 lines** (preservation directive intact through 12 consecutive releases)
- `grep -i "WGU policies 8\."` in deliverable → 0 hits (CHANGELOG meta-context allowed)
- `grep -i "section cards\|section_id"` in deliverable → 0 hits
- `grep -i "3 live SDP"` in deliverable → 0 hits
- All 4 Pass 14 findings verified clean

## v4.14 — 08 May 2026 — Seventh overboard sweep (Jira + AWS region IDs + WGU Policy 8.x citations + section leakage + 1,247 sessions)

Pass 13 (post-v4.13 independent audit) found **6 items** — concentrated in places prior code-focused passes had only spot-checked (incident-response screens 17–22, geo-redundancy screen 7, instructor screens 4 + 8, FERPA control table). v4.14 closes all 6. **No screens removed** (still 77); all in-place text edits.

### Trimmed — `Jira` vendor naming outside vendor-config UI

SOW §9.5 commits to a 2-hour P1 response time but does not commit to Jira (Atlassian) as the ticketing vendor. Same vendor-naming-outside-vendor-context rationale that drove v4.10–v4.12.

Sites edited (5 across 3 files):
- `tenant_admin/index.html:2298` — `<button>...Open Jira ticket</button>` → "Open P1 ticket"
- `tenant_admin/index.html:2306` — HTML comment "Screen 19: Jira P1 ticket creation form" → "Screen 19: P1 ticket creation form"
- `tenant_admin/index.html:2328` — `<h1>Log a P1 incident in Jira</h1>` → "Log a P1 incident with JFT Support"
- `presentation.html:771` + `presentation_dark.html:771` SC-ADD-06 workflow narrative — "logs a P1 ticket in Jira. The JFT Customer Success Manager responds within 2 hours" → "logs a P1 ticket with JFT Support. JFT Support acknowledges within the §9.5 2-hour P1 SLA (with the JFT CSM as WGU-facing POC per §9.1.4)" (also closes the catalog-narrative CSM-vs-Support SLA conflation that v4.9 fixed in the storyboard but missed here)

### Trimmed — AWS-specific region IDs + city locations on Geo-Redundancy screen 7

`us-east-1` / `us-west-2` / `eu-west-1` are AWS-specific availability-zone identifiers; `Northern Virginia, USA` / `Oregon, USA` / `Dublin, Ireland` are AWS data-center locations. SOW §9.5 commits to geo-redundancy generically; nothing in SOW or v1.3 catalog names AWS or specific zones. Same rationale as v4.12 dropping `(RDS)` and named internal services.

Sites edited (`super_admin/index.html`):
- Region cards (lines 1376–1411): "us-east-1" / "us-west-2" / "eu-west-1" → "Primary region · US East" / "Secondary region · US West" / "DR region · EU"
- Region card sub-text: city-specific locations → role-specific descriptions ("Active region serving most learners" / "Hot standby for failover" / "Disaster-recovery region")
- Failover test table (lines 1439–1442) From/To columns: AWS zone IDs → "Primary" / "Secondary" / "DR"
- Audit log (line 1599): `failover.probe (us-east → eu-west)` → `failover.probe (Primary → DR)`
- `presentation.html:712` + `presentation_dark.html:712` SC-ADD-04 step 7 narrative: "us-east-1 primary / us-west-2 secondary / eu-west-1 DR" → "Primary US East / Secondary US West / DR EU"

### Trimmed — "section" framing leakage in instructor

v4.13 caught "Sally's section" on tenant_admin screen 8 but missed two instructor sites. README line 202 + the rolling-enrollment rule forbid "section" framing.

Sites edited (`instructor/index.html`):
- Line 1008 (screen 4 at-risk filter alert): "the lowest score in the section" → "the lowest score in this course"
- Line 1439 (screen 8 audit-trail compliance footer): "Charlie's view is constrained to his sections by RBAC" → "Charlie's view is constrained to his courses by RBAC"

### Trimmed — fabricated `WGU Policy 8.4` and `WGU Policy 8.2` citations

The 34 CFR §99.10 / §99.31 / §99.32 / §99.37 federal-regulation citations elsewhere in the FERPA control table are real. But "WGU Policy 8.4" / "8.2" were invented internal-policy numbers — no SOW or catalog grounding, and these aren't legally verifiable WGU policy references.

Sites edited (`super_admin/index.html`):
- Line 1303 "Annual data breach response drill | WGU Policy 8.4" → "WGU institutional policy"
- Line 1304 "Staff FERPA training (annual) | WGU Policy 8.2" → "WGU institutional policy"

### Trimmed — "1,247 sessions" fabricated specific

The number ricocheted across SC-ADD-06 incident screens (17, 19, 22) and the catalog narrative as if authoritative. No SOW or catalog text specifies a session count for the incident scenario. Same class as v4.9's "213/600 rate-limit usage" trim.

Sites edited (5 across 3 files):
- `tenant_admin/index.html:2229` (screen 17 Fallback row sub-text): "1,247 sessions migrated transparently" → "All active learner sessions migrated transparently"
- `tenant_admin/index.html:2369` (screen 19 P1 ticket description textarea): "1,247 active learner sessions migrated transparently" → "All active learner sessions migrated transparently"
- `tenant_admin/index.html:2556` (screen 22 service status table Learner sessions row): `1,247 active` / `1,247 active · 0 dropped` / `1,261 active` → `All active` / `All active · 0 dropped` / `All active`
- `presentation.html:777` + `presentation_dark.html:777` SC-ADD-06 step 2 narrative: "fallback LLM provider active and serving 1,247 sessions per §6.5" → "fallback LLM provider active and serving all active learner sessions per §6.5"

## v4.13 — 08 May 2026 — Sixth overboard sweep (catalog-narrative + READMEs + root-index leakage; v4.0 staleness across portal titles/footers)

Pass 12 (post-v4.12 independent audit) found **17 items** the previous five sweeps missed — concentrated in surfaces the prior code-focused passes had under-audited: catalog scenario narratives, per-portal READMEs, the root `index.html` portal-selector landing, and `v4.0`-vintage portal titles + footers that were never bumped after the initial release. v4.13 closes all 17. **No screens removed** (still 77); all in-place text edits.

### Trimmed / softened — instructor/ audit-log leakage (v4.10/v4.12 oversight)

The SC-ADD-03 Audit Trail event log (instructor screen 8) still listed three sources that had been generic-ized elsewhere in v4.10 + v4.12:
- Row 4 "Guardrail svc" → "SDP Coach"
- Row 5 "Anthropic Claude Sonnet 4.5" → "Primary LLM provider"
- Row 7 "Scoring engine" → "SDP Coach"

Same generic-ization rationale as v4.12: audit-log displays are not vendor-picker context, and named internal architecture components ("Guardrail svc", "Scoring engine") are implementation detail beyond the SOW.

### Trimmed — `super_admin/index.html` "via cert-manager"

Compliance Report (screen 6) tail copy named a specific Kubernetes-ecosystem auto-renewal tool. Implementation detail comparable to "(RDS)" v4.12 dropped. Trimmed to "Auto-renewal is enabled across all services."

### Trimmed — `tenant_admin/index.html` "3 available" datasets + "Sally's section"

- Screen 10 (Data & APIs landing) Quick exports table row: "Datasets · 3 available" → "Datasets · Engagement metrics (v1.3)" — matches the v4.10 trim of the export wizard from 3 datasets to 1 (engagement metrics only).
- Screen 8 (Review & Deploy) deploy-warning alert: "live for all learners on Sally's section" → "live for all active learners in this Subject" — "section" framing forbidden by the rolling-enrollment rule (README line 202).

### Trimmed — catalog scenario narratives in `presentation.html` + `presentation_dark.html`

Catalog narratives had not been refreshed after the v4.4–v4.12 storyboard sweeps and were describing pre-trim screens:

- **Per-persona portals list (line 568):** "Alice (Tenant Admin) ... 23 screens" → "27 screens" (v4.4 extended Tenant Admin)
- **SC-ADD-02 step 2 narrative:** "Three subjects (E010 in production, E075 staging, E120 draft)" → "Four subjects (E010 production, E135 production, E075 staging, E120 draft)" (matches current portal home Subjects list)
- **SC-ADD-02 step 5 narrative:** "Recent versions panel ... last 3 prompt edits" → "one-line 'Last edited' indicator" (matches v4.8 collapse)
- **SC-ADD-03 step 2 narrative:** "Charlie's three sections (E010 § 042 active, E075 § 018, E135 § 003). Active section shows..." → "Charlie's three courses (E010, E075, E135) under WGU's rolling-enrollment model — no fixed sections or cohorts. Active course (E010) shows..." (rolling-enrollment rule)
- **SC-ADD-03 step 3 narrative:** "Search by name / email (deep-links to screen 9)" → removed (v4.9 dropped screen 9)
- **SC-ADD-04 step 6 narrative:** "17/17 services TLS 1.3 ... 7-yr audit trail retention ... 10-row service-by-service TLS table with cipher" → "all paths TLS 1.3 ... audit trail retention per institutional policy ... service-by-service TLS table (TLS version + cert expiry + last scan + pass status)" (matches v4.11 + v4.12 trims)
- **SC-ADD-05 step 1 narrative:** "REST API (auth, base URL, 14 endpoints, 600 req/hr) ... 3 datasets" → "REST API (OAuth 2.0 auth, base URL, per-tenant rate limit, endpoint catalog finalized at onboarding) ... engagement metrics dataset" (matches v4.9 + v4.10 trims)
- **SC-ADD-05 step 2 narrative:** "213/600 rate-limit usage" → "rate-limit usage well below tenant tier cap" (matches v4.9 trim)

### Trimmed — `super_admin/README.md` "across 17 services"

Two mentions ("encryption audit §10.7 across 17 services" + "TLS 1.3 verification across 17 services") softened to "across all data paths" — matches v4.12 storyboard wording.

### Trimmed — `tenant_admin/README.md` "7-year retention" + "JFT CSM ... 2-hr SLA"

- "FERPA-aligned 7-year retention" → "FERPA-aligned retention per institutional policy" (matches v4.10 + v4.11 trims)
- "JFT CSM chat thread (within 2-hr SLA)" → "JFT Support P1 response thread within 2-hr SLA per §9.5 (CSM Jordan as WGU-facing POC)" (matches v4.9 reframe of CSM-vs-Support SLA ownership)
- "The CSM chat thread on screen 21 demonstrates within-2-hr SLA response" → reframed to clarify SLA is owned by JFT Support per §9.5; CSM Jordan is the §9.1.4 WGU-facing POC

### Bumped — root `index.html` portal-selector landing

Never updated after the v4.0 initial release. Refreshed:
- Hero eyebrow "v4.0" → "v4.13"
- Hero stat "73 Screens" → "77 Screens"
- Tenant Admin card "23 screens" → "27 screens"
- Instructor card "Charlie · course instructor" → "Charlie · Instructor" (User Profile canonical)
- Catalog card "148 screenshots" → "156 screenshots"
- Footer "Storyboard v4.0" → "Storyboard v4.13"
- HTML comment "23 screens" → "27 screens"

### Bumped — portal `index.html` titles + footers (v4.0 vintage)

Three portal HTMLs had `<title>... Storyboard v4.0</title>` and visible footers `Storyboard v4.0 — Western Governors University` since the initial release:
- `instructor/index.html` — title + footer + persona comment "course instructor" → "Instructor"
- `super_admin/index.html` — title + footer
- `lrps/index.html` — title + footer

All bumped to v4.13.

### Bumped — catalog hero `Storyboard v4.0` → `Storyboard v4.13`

Both `presentation.html` + `presentation_dark.html` hero `<div class="hero-doc-info">` showed `Storyboard v4.0` despite footers being bumped each release. Now matches footer.

### Verification

- `git diff --stat student/index.html` returns **0 lines** (preservation directive intact through 10 consecutive releases)
- `grep -i "Storyboard v4\.0"` in deliverable HTML/MD → 0 hits in current state (allowed in CHANGELOG meta-context)

## v4.12 — 08 May 2026 — Fifth overboard sweep (TLS cipher specifics + vendor model names in subject metadata)

Pass 11 (post-v4.11) found 2 more items. v4.12 closes both. **No screens removed** (still 77); all in-place text edits.

### Trimmed — TLS cipher suite specifics on Super Admin Compliance Report (screen 6)

The Compliance Report listed 10 services with specific cipher suites (`TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384`, `TLS_CHACHA20_POLY1305_SHA256`, `TLS_AES_128_GCM_SHA256`) plus a 7-additional-services footnote naming "Guardrail svc, Scoring engine, Cache layer, Vector store, Stepper coordinator, Notification svc, CSM bridge."

- **SOW §10.7:** "Encryption (TLS 1.3) across all data paths." Cipher suite selection is implementation detail.
- **No SOW or catalog text** commits to specific cipher algorithms or names internal architecture components like "Vector store" / "Stepper coordinator."

Edits (`super_admin/index.html`):
- Removed the "Cipher" column from the service table (kept TLS version 1.3 + cert expiry + last scan + status)
- Consolidated provider-specific rows: "Model Router → Anthropic" + "Model Router → OpenAI (fallback)" + "Model Router → Google (fallback)" → 2 generic rows ("primary LLM provider" + "fallback LLM providers")
- Removed "(RDS)" implementation detail from "Tenant DB" row
- Replaced 7-named-services footnote with "Additional internal platform services use TLS 1.3 encryption identically; details available in the PDF export for compliance audits"
- KPI gauge: "17/17 Services TLS 1.3" → "All paths · TLS 1.3" (count was implementation-specific)
- Audit log "17/17 pass" badge → "All paths pass"

### Trimmed — vendor model names in subject metadata rows

After v4.10's vendor-naming sweep across the SC-ADD-06 incident scenario, model names still appeared in subject metadata rows on tenant_admin screen 2 (portal home Subjects list) and screen 27 (Subject Lifecycle Active Subjects table). Pass 11 noted both:
1. The names are informational metadata (not vendor-picker context), inconsistent with the v4.10 rule.
2. The two screens were inconsistent with each other ("Claude Sonnet 4.5" vs. "Claude 3.5 Sonnet"; "GPT-5" vs. "GPT-4o") — fabricated specifics that drifted.

Edits (`tenant_admin/index.html`):
- Screen 2 portal home Subjects list (3 rows): dropped " · Claude Sonnet 4.5" / " · GPT-5" suffixes
- Screen 27 Subject Lifecycle Active Subjects (3 rows): dropped " · Claude 3.5 Sonnet" / " · GPT-4o" annotations from Subject ID metadata lines

Vendor names retained on:
- Screen 6 (Choose the Preferred Model) — vendor-picker UI, appropriate
- Screen 7 (Configure Scoring & Rubric) — fallback chain config display, appropriate
- Screen 8 (Review & Deploy) — review-of-Alice's-choices, appropriate

### Verification

- `git diff --stat student/index.html` returns **0 lines** (preservation directive intact through 9 consecutive releases)
- `grep "TLS_AES\|TLS_CHACHA"` → 0 hits (cipher names removed)
- `grep "Vector store\|Stepper coordinator\|Guardrail svc"` → 0 hits in deliverable (retained in CHANGELOG meta-context)
- Vendor names contained to model-picker / fallback-chain / Review screens; absent from data displays
- "Claude 3.5 Sonnet" vs "Claude Sonnet 4.5" inconsistency resolved by removing both from data displays
- Forbidden-term sweep clean

### Numbers

| | v4.11 | v4.12 |
|---|---|---|
| Total storyboard screens | 77 | **77** (no removals) |
| TLS cipher names in deliverable | 3 | **0** |
| Vendor model names in subject metadata | 6 | **0** |

## v4.11 — 08 May 2026 — Fourth overboard sweep (escaped vendor name + 7-year retention claims trimmed)

Pass 10 (independent post-v4.10 audit) found 2 items v4.10 missed. v4.11 closes both. **No screens removed** (still 77); all in-place text edits.

### Trimmed — escaped vendor name on SC-ADD-06 baseline screen 16

v4.10 generic-ized the SC-ADD-06 incident scenario (screens 17–23) but the **baseline** screen 16 ("All systems operational") still had "Claude Sonnet 4.5 (primary) · 99.99% past 24h · p50 latency 213 ms" in the Model Router operational status row. That contradicted the v4.10 LLM-agnostic stance.

Site edited (`tenant_admin/index.html` line ~2111):
- "Claude Sonnet 4.5 (primary) · 99.99% past 24h · p50 latency 213 ms" → "Primary LLM provider · 99.99% past 24h · p50 latency 213 ms"

### Softened — all 7 "7 years" / "7 yr" retention mentions

v4.10 softened the most prominent "7 years (FERPA default)" claim on Subject Lifecycle screen 27 but explicitly deferred 7 other sites with "if Pass 10 disagrees, fix in next cycle." Pass 10 disagreed.

- **SOW §10.1:** "FERPA Compliance" — generic; does not specify 7 years.
- **SOW §10.2 / answer row #10.2:** "default three years" for inactive learner data (a different scope).
- **MSA §10c:** "no more than sixty (60) days after termination" for JFT's data-retention obligation.
- **v1.3 catalog:** no mention of 7-year retention anywhere.

The "7 years" claims across audit-log captions weren't configured-value displays — they were declarative policy statements ("for 7 years," "retention 7 years") that implied a JFT-side default. Trimmed all of them.

Sites edited:
- `tenant_admin/index.html` line ~967 (portal home hero): "All actions audit-logged for 7 years" → "All actions audit-logged per institutional retention policy"
- `tenant_admin/index.html` line ~1105 (portal home footer): "Audit log retention: 7 years (FERPA)" → "Audit log retention: per institutional policy (FERPA-aligned)"

- `super_admin/index.html` line ~1610 (Audit Log footer): "Retention: 7 years (FERPA)" → "Retention: per institutional policy (FERPA-aligned)"
- `presentation.html` + `presentation_dark.html` SC-ADD-04 step 8 narrative: "Retention: 7 years (FERPA)" → "Retention: per institutional policy (FERPA-aligned)"
- `presentation.html` + `presentation_dark.html` SC-ADD-02 step 13 (Subject Lifecycle) narrative: "FERPA-aligned 7-year retention dates" → "retention dates per institutional policy"

Note: the "3 yr inactive learner data retention" gauge on `super_admin/index.html` Compliance Report (screen 6) is **kept** — that maps to SOW §10.2 "default three years" for inactive learner data, which IS contractually committed. Different scope from audit-log retention.

### Verification

- `git diff --stat student/index.html` returns **0 lines** (preservation directive intact through v4.4 → v4.5 → v4.6 → v4.7 → v4.8 → v4.9 → v4.10 → v4.11)
- `grep -i "7 years\|7-year\|7 yr"` in tracked deliverable HTML/MD → 0 hits in current state (CHANGELOG + Document Control historical references allowed)
- `grep "Claude Sonnet 4.5\|Anthropic"` → only on model-picker / Subjects-list / rubric (vendor-picker contexts); 0 hits in SC-ADD-06 baseline + incident narrative
- Forbidden-term sweep clean

### Numbers

| | v4.10 | v4.11 |
|---|---|---|
| Total storyboard screens | 77 | **77** (no removals) |
| "7 years" / "7 yr" retention mentions | 8 | **0** |
| Vendor names in SC-ADD-06 narrative | 1 escaped | **0** |

## v4.10 — 08 May 2026 — Third overboard sweep (Parquet + LLM vendor naming + 7-year FERPA claim + 3 export datasets)

After v4.9 Brady asked for another adversarial pass. Pass 9 found 4 more items not actually SOW-grounded. v4.10 closes them. **No screens removed** (still 77); all in-place text edits.

### Trimmed — Parquet format (not in SOW or catalog)

- **SOW §8.9:** "Data exports will be available in JSON, CSV, or XML formats."
- **v1.3 catalog SC-ADD-05:** "She uses one-click export to download a JSON or CSV file."
- Parquet appears in neither. It was added during v4.0 prototyping as a "more modern" option.

Sites edited:
- `tenant_admin/index.html` screen 2 quick-launch caption: "CSV / JSON / Parquet" → "CSV / JSON"
- `tenant_admin/index.html` screen 14 format-picker tab switcher: 3 tabs → 2 tabs (CSV / JSON; Parquet button removed)
- `presentation.html` + `presentation_dark.html` SC-ADD-05 step 5 narrative: "CSV / JSON / Parquet tab switcher" → "CSV / JSON tab switcher"
- `README.md` SC-ADD-05 row caption + `tenant_admin/README.md` scenario row + components list

### Generic-ized — "Primary LLM (Anthropic)" / "Fallback (GPT-5)" in SC-ADD-06 incident scenario

- **SOW §6.1:** "LLM-agnostic orchestration layer that uses provider SDKs and configurable rules to steer traffic between GPT-4o, Claude, Gemini, and future models."
- **§6.5:** "fail over to a secondary LLM."
- The contract treats all three providers as equivalent options. Naming Anthropic specifically as "the primary" implies a vendor commitment that isn't contracted.

Sites edited (`tenant_admin/index.html` SC-ADD-06 incident screens 17/18/19/21/22/23):
- "Primary LLM (Anthropic)" → "Primary LLM provider" (4 sites)
- "Fallback LLM (GPT-5)" → "Fallback LLM provider" (2 sites)
- Narrative + ticket textarea + chat-thread copy generic-ized; §6.5 cited explicitly
- Vendor names retained on the model picker (screen 6) and rubric (screen 7) — those are vendor-picker UIs where naming is appropriate

`presentation.html` + `presentation_dark.html` SC-ADD-06 step 17 narrative similarly generic-ized.

### Softened — Subject Lifecycle "7 years (FERPA default)"

- **SOW §10.1:** "FERPA Compliance" — generic; does not specify 7 years.
- The "FERPA default" phrasing implied a JFT-side default that isn't contracted.

Site edited (`tenant_admin/index.html` screen 27):
- Retention badge: "7 years (FERPA default)" → "Per institutional policy"
- Caption: "Per §10.1; locked by Super Admin policy" → "FERPA-aligned; configured at the platform level (§10.1)"

Other "7 years" mentions (audit-log retention captions on screens 2 / 10 / 15, Super Admin compliance KPI on screen 6) are kept — those are configured-value displays rather than policy claims about a JFT-default. If Pass 10 disagrees, fix in next cycle.

### Trimmed — Export wizard from 3 datasets to 1

- **v1.3 catalog SC-ADD-05:** "She uses one-click export to download a JSON or CSV file **with engagement metrics**." Singular dataset.
- **SOW §7.14:** generic "one-click exports" — doesn't enumerate dataset types.
- The original 3-card layout (Engagement metrics / Score history / Conversation logs) extrapolated beyond catalog; conversation transcripts in particular raise FERPA / PII scope not addressed in the contract.

Site edited (`tenant_admin/index.html` screen 13):
- 3 radio cards → 1 radio card (engagement metrics, selected)
- Tip alert reframed: "Engagement metrics is the v1.3 contracted dataset (per SC-ADD-05 catalog narrative + SOW §8.7). Additional datasets such as score history and conversation transcripts are post-pilot roadmap candidates pending FERPA scope review."

### Verification

- `git diff --stat student/index.html` returns **0 lines** (preservation directive intact through v4.4 → v4.5 → v4.6 → v4.7 → v4.8 → v4.9 → v4.10)
- All `goToScreen(N)` references valid; no broken nav
- `grep -i "parquet"` → 0 hits in deliverable surfaces (CHANGELOG meta-context allowed)
- Vendor naming retained only on model-picker / config screens; absent from incident narrative

### Numbers

| | Before v4.10 | After v4.10 |
|---|---|---|
| Total storyboard screens | 77 | **77** (no removals; in-place edits) |
| `tenant_admin/` | 27 | 27 |
| Export wizard dataset cards | 3 | **1** |
| Format-picker tabs | 3 | **2** |
| Vendor names in SC-ADD-06 narrative | Anthropic + GPT-5 | generic |

## v4.9 — 08 May 2026 — Second overboard sweep (REST API specifics + CSM SLA framing + Instructor Learner Search)

After v4.8 Brady asked for another adversarial pass. A fresh independent agent (Pass 8) found 3 more items that were over-extrapolated. v4.9 closes them.

### Trimmed — REST API specifics fabricated (Tenant Admin)

The v4.0 prototype invented "14 endpoints" and "600 req/hour" as plausible defaults for the API console. Re-reading the SOW main body and v1.3 SC-ADD-05 catalog, neither commits to those numbers — §8.7 commits to a "RESTful API for student engagement data export" generically. The catalog narrative is just "Alice uses the RESTful API to query student scores."

Sites edited (`tenant_admin/index.html`):
- Screen 2 (portal home) SC-ADD-05 quick-launch caption: "OAuth 2.0, 600 req/hr" → "OAuth 2.0, per-tenant rate limit"
- Screen 10 (Data & APIs landing) Programmatic-access table:
  - "Endpoints · 14 available" → "Endpoints · Catalog finalized at onboarding"
  - "Rate limit · 600 req/hour" → "Rate limit · Per tenant tier"
- Screen 11 (REST API console) usage indicator: "Rate limit · 213 / 600 req/hour" → "Rate limit · Well below tenant tier cap"

The trim makes the prototype honest about what JFT will configure later vs. what's already determined.

### Trimmed — "JFT CSM 2-hour SLA" framing conflated §9.5 + §9.1.4

SOW §9.5 specifies the JFT support P1 response time as <2 hours. §9.1.4 lists the Customer Success Manager as a business-hours WGU-facing POC. The v4.0 storyboard labeled the SC-ADD-06 chat thread "JFT CSM 2-hour SLA," conflating the two roles. The CSM is a person who acknowledges within the §9.5 window; the SLA itself is a JFT-support commitment.

Sites edited (`tenant_admin/index.html`):
- Screen 2 SC-ADD-06 quick-launch description: "JFT CSM 2-hour SLA" → "JFT support 2-hour P1 response per §9.5"
- Screen 21 (CSM chat thread) eyebrow: "Customer Success Response · Within 2-hr SLA" → "JFT Support P1 Response · §9.5 (CSM Jordan as WGU-facing POC)"
- Chat-bubble badges (CSM Jordan acknowledged at 6 min) are factually OK and unchanged — Jordan is the CSM, who acknowledged within the §9.5 window.

### Removed — `instructor/index.html` screen 9 (Learner Search)

The screen was added in v4.4 as G2, originally Mike's "Gradebook" suggestion that I retargeted as "Learner Search." Reading the v1.3 SC-ADD-03 catalog narrative literally: "Charlie accesses the Instructor Dashboard via secret LRPS deep link and opens the Data Visualization panel showing a Student Heatmap. He identifies Sally as at-risk: assessment complete, AI-scored competency low. He drills into her conversation logs to review AI feedback…" — there is no search step. The User Profile says "drill into individual student performance records" (singular drill-down), not "search across all."

Removed:
- Entire `<section id="screen-9">` block (~190 lines)
- "Search learners" button on screen 2 (linked to screen 9)
- "Search by name / email" chip on screen 3 heatmap (linked to screen 9)
- Meta-bar nav button "09"
- `TOTAL_SCREENS` 9 → 8
- 2 PNG screenshots (light + dark)

Catalog updates (`presentation.html` + `presentation_dark.html`):
- SC-ADD-03 step 9 entry removed
- SC-ADD-03 metadata: 9 → 8 screens; SOW refs trimmed (dropped §7.12; kept §7.10/7.11/7.13/7.14/10.4)
- Screen-map summary: 78 → 77 total
- Document Control: new v1.3+++ row noting v4.9 trim
- Footer: Storyboard v4.8 → v4.9

`instructor/README.md`: scenarios row 9 → 8; SOW refs trimmed.

### Verification

- `git diff --stat student/index.html` returns **0 lines** (preservation directive intact through v4.4 → v4.5 → v4.6 → v4.7 → v4.8 → v4.9)
- `instructor/screenshots/` and `screenshots_dark/` each have 8 PNGs
- All `goToScreen(N)` references valid (zero broken nav)
- 0 hits for "14 available", "600 req/hour", "JFT CSM 2-hour SLA" in tracked deliverable HTML/MD (CHANGELOG meta-context allowed)
- Forbidden-term sweep clean

### Numbers

| | Before v4.9 | After v4.9 |
|---|---|---|
| Total storyboard screens | 78 | **77** |
| `instructor/` | 9 | 8 |
| `tenant_admin/` | 27 | 27 (Findings 1 + 2 are in-place text edits) |

## v4.8 — 08 May 2026 — Overboard trim (3 Super Admin screens removed; Tenant Admin home + screen 5 trimmed)

Brady ran a fresh contract-grounding audit and confirmed prior agents (myself included) had built features that weren't actually in the SOW main body. v4.8 removes the overboard items so the prototype reflects only what JFT contracted to deliver.

### Removed — 3 Super Admin screens (added in v4.4 as inferred "gap fills")

- **`super_admin/index.html` screen 9 (Third-Party Integrations).** OpenRouter / AWS / Datadog / Entra ID / GitHub / Slack deep-link cards. SOW §2.4 commits to "AI orchestration layer supporting multiple LLM providers" as **internal architecture**, not as a Super Admin-facing vendor-management UI. JFT's vendor management is operational ops, not a JFT deliverable. The original justification was a Brady in-conversation remark ("links to all the 3rd party tools that are setup, like AWS as well") — not a SOW commitment.
- **`super_admin/index.html` screen 10 (Learner Remediation).** Cross-tenant per-learner score reset / force re-diagnostic / pause access with required-justification audit log. SOW commits to data export and audit logging, not data **modification**. Score reset crosses into FERPA territory (modifying education records). Not in v1.3 catalog or User Profile. Original justification was a Brady in-conversation remark ("resetting a user's score, that would be a Global Admin feature") — not contracted.
- **`super_admin/index.html` screen 11 (Billing & Cost Centers).** Per-tenant cost-center allocation table + per-model spend split + budget alerts. §11.1 specifies what JFT bills WGU; it does not commit to a UI for WGU's **internal** cost-center allocation across PDev / SOB / SOH. That's WGU's accounting concern, not a JFT deliverable. Token-usage / API-spend tracking is contract-committed (already exists on screen 3); cross-tenant cost-center reconciliation isn't.

`super_admin/index.html` returns to **8 screens** (matches the v1.3 SC-ADD-04 catalog narrative as originally authored).

Side cleanup:
- Super Admin screen 2 (portal home): removed the v4.4 second row of quick-link cards (Integrations / Learner Remediation / Billing / Audit Log). Kept the original 4-card row (Token Usage / Rate Limits / Compliance / Geo-Redundancy).
- Super Admin meta-bar nav: removed buttons 09 / 10 / 11.
- 6 PNG screenshots removed (3 light + 3 dark).

### Trimmed — Tenant Admin Portal home (screen 2)

The v4.7 hub redesign over-promised real-time platform-monitoring features that belong to Super Admin per the User Profile. v4.8 trims back to program-level scope:

- **Removed** the "Recent activity" feed (right-column 6-event timeline). Implied real-time event aggregation across all 3 scenarios is not a contracted UI capability.
- **Removed** the "System Status · Operational" KPI gauge. Per the User Profile, infrastructure status is Bob's (Super Admin) scope, not Alice's (Tenant Admin). Tenant Admin sees their own tenant's module status, not platform-wide health.
- **Removed** the "SLA Uptime · 30D" KPI gauge. SLA reporting is contract-committed (SC-ADD-06 has it on screen 23) but surfacing it on the Tenant Admin home as a real-time metric isn't in the SC-ADD-02 narrative.
- **Kept** the 2 program-level KPIs ("Subjects Live" + "Exports This Week") — these are grounded in Tenant Admin scope per §2.5.
- **Kept** the 3-domain quick-launch row (Course Configuration / Data & APIs / System Status). Pure navigation; no functionality claim.
- **Kept** the Subjects list (now full-width since the right column is gone).
- **Kept** the "What's next?" cross-scenario CTA panels on screens 9 / 15 / 23 from v4.7 — pure UX integration, no functionality claim.

### Trimmed — Tenant Admin screen 5 prompt-versions panel

The v4.4 G9 "Recent versions" panel (3-row table + footnote) was based on a Brady in-conversation request for "minimal indication for JFT to push back if too hard." v4.8 takes that "minimal" framing more literally: collapsed to a single-line indicator showing "Last edited 07 May · v3 · Alice" with a "View history" link and a deferred-feature note. Same intent, much smaller surface.

### Catalog updates

`presentation.html` + `presentation_dark.html`:
- Removed SC-ADD-04 step 9 / 10 / 11 entries.
- SC-ADD-04 metadata: 11 → 8 screens; SOW refs trimmed to §6.4, §6.6, §9.5, §10.1, §10.4, §10.7 (dropped §2.4, §2.5 ambiguous, §9.13, §11.1).
- Screen-map summary: 81 → 78 total.
- Document Control table records the v4.8 trim with full rationale.
- Footer bumped to Storyboard v4.8.

### Verification

- `git diff --stat student/index.html` returns **0 lines** (preservation directive intact through v4.4 → v4.5 → v4.6 → v4.7 → v4.8)
- 6 super_admin orphan PNGs removed; remaining 158 screenshots regenerated
- All `goToScreen(N)` references valid (no broken nav)
- Forbidden-term sweep clean

### Numbers

| | Before v4.8 | After v4.8 |
|---|---|---|
| Total storyboard screens | 81 | **78** |
| `super_admin/` | 11 | 8 |
| `tenant_admin/` | 27 | 27 (screen 2 + screen 5 trimmed in place) |
| `instructor/` | 9 | 9 |
| `student/` | 34 | 34 (frozen) |
| `lrps/` | 1 | 1 |
| PNGs | 164 | 158 |

### What's still kept that was added in v4.4

These items were re-validated against SOW + scenarios and confirmed contract-grounded:
- `tenant_admin/26` Instructor Roster (§2.5 instructors + §10.8 RBAC)
- `tenant_admin/27` Subject Lifecycle (§2.5 module lifecycle + §10.4 audit logging)
- `instructor/9` Learner Search (§7.10 + §7.12)
- `instructor/3` heatmap export CTAs (§7.14)

### Lesson learned

In-conversation remarks during prototyping are NOT contract commitments. v4.4–v4.7 conflated the two; v4.8 corrects that. Future iterations should re-cite SOW main-body sections (with literal quotes ≤15 words) before proposing new screens — not "Brady mentioned X" remembered from chat.

---

## v4.7 — 07 May 2026 — Tenant Admin polish pass (SC-ADD-02 / 05 / 06 unified experience)

The three Tenant Admin scenarios had been stitched together by the meta-bar and a basic portal home. v4.7 turns them into a single polished Alice experience: a hub-style portal home that lights up across all three scenarios, plus cross-scenario "what's next?" CTAs at each scenario completion screen so the journey feels intentional instead of three separate demos.

### Changed — `tenant_admin/index.html` screen 2 (Tenant Admin Portal home) redesigned as the central hub

The portal home was a single Subject list + 3 buttons. Now it's a full hub:

- **Hero** — "Welcome back, Alice" with tenant scoping (PDev / IT) and the 7-year audit-log retention disclosure inline.
- **4 KPI gauges spanning all 3 scenarios** — Subjects Live (SC-ADD-02), SLA Uptime · 30D (SC-ADD-06), Exports This Week (SC-ADD-05), and System Status (SC-ADD-06). Each has color-coded status dots + target/headroom captions.
- **3-domain quick-launch row** — three featured cards labeled with their scenario IDs, each with a primary CTA + secondary deep-link:
  - Configure courses (SC-ADD-02): New Subject + Tenant Settings
  - Data & APIs (SC-ADD-05): API Console + Start Export
  - System status (SC-ADD-06): System Status + SLA Dashboard
- **Two-column body** — Your Subjects (4-row list — added E135 to the list to reflect the most recent deploy) on the left, **Recent activity feed** on the right showing 6 events from across all three scenarios with timestamps + scenario labels (`SC-ADD-06 · Service restored`, `SC-ADD-05 · Export complete`, `SC-ADD-02 · Subject deployed`, etc.). The activity feed is the visual proof that the three scenarios are one cohesive operation, not three separate demos.
- **Bottom CTAs** — New Subject + Tenant Settings + an audit-retention reminder.

### Changed — Cross-scenario "What's next?" CTAs at each scenario's completion screen

Each scenario used to dead-end at "Back to Portal." Now they invite the next logical action.

- **Screen 9** (SC-ADD-02 deploy success) — added a "What's next?" panel below the success message with three CTAs: Export E135 baseline metrics (jumps to SC-ADD-05 step 4), Check system status (jumps to SC-ADD-06 step 1), Query via REST API (jumps to SC-ADD-05 step 2). Reinforces that a deploy normally precedes a baseline-metrics export and a status check.
- **Screen 15** (SC-ADD-05 export complete) — added a "What's next?" panel with three CTAs: SLA dashboard (SC-ADD-06 step 8), Portal home, New Subject. Frames the export as part of an ongoing tenant operation, not a terminal action.
- **Screen 23** (SC-ADD-06 SLA dashboard) — added a "What's next?" panel with three CTAs: Export incident report (SC-ADD-05 step 4), Portal home, Configure another Subject (SC-ADD-02 step 3). Plus the existing "Next SLA report" alert now hyperlinks to the Data & APIs panel.

### Changed — minor

- `tenant_admin/index.html` CSS — added `.gauge-number.good { color: var(--pgn-color-success-base); }` rule for parity with `super_admin/index.html`. The class was used implicitly on the new portal home gauges; making it explicit prevents future drift.
- 164 screenshots regenerated. Tenant Admin screens 2 (the redesign) + 9 / 15 / 23 (cross-scenario CTAs) + every other admin-portal screen had minor pixel diffs from the regeneration. `student/index.html` source still 0 lines changed.

### Why this matters

Per Brady's direction: SC-ADD-02 / 05 / 06 are not three separate demos JFT will build separately — they are one Tenant Admin experience that Alice lives inside as a daily workflow. The polish pass:
1. Establishes the portal home as the visual centerpiece (hub model, not a launcher).
2. Makes the cross-scenario data flow visible (the 24h activity feed shows how the three scenarios touch each other in time).
3. Replaces dead-end completion screens with cross-scenario invitations that reflect realistic operations (deploy → export, export → SLA review, incident response → next config).
4. Keeps screen count at 81 (no new screens; pure UX integration of existing 27 Tenant Admin screens).

### Verification

- `git diff --stat student/index.html` returns 0 lines (preservation directive intact)
- All Tenant Admin screens render in both light + dark themes (164 PNGs regenerated)
- `goToScreen(N)` cross-references in new CTAs all point to existing screens (3, 11, 13, 16, 23)
- Forbidden-term sweep clean (the v4.5/v4.6 audit list re-checked; 0 hits)

---

## v4.6 — 07 May 2026 — Adversarial accessibility / design-system / nav re-audit (2 consecutive clean passes)

Second 2-pass-clean compliance audit, this time with **adversarial framing** — fresh agents instructed to be skeptical of v4.5's "0 issues" claim and look harder at niche dimensions (WCAG 2.2 AA accessibility, design-system token compliance, cross-portal navigation, niche SOW main-body sections, sub-step granularity). Pass 5 caught real gaps that prior passes pattern-matched past; v4.6 closes them. **Pass 6 + Pass 7 both reported 0 issues** — full SOW + scenario compliance re-verified under stricter framing.

### Pass 5 findings (closed in v4.6)

**Blocker — WCAG 2.2 AA §2.4.7 violation across 6 portal HTML files.** Each file's CSS contained a heading-specific `:focus-visible { outline: none }` override that suppressed the standard 3px Bright Blue focus ring on all H1–H6 elements. The base `:focus-visible` rule above it was correct; the override was an artifact of an earlier iteration that didn't want focus rings visible during programmatic focus changes (capture pipeline already handles screenshot suppression separately). Removed the override in 5 modifiable portals (`index.html`, `lrps/index.html`, `tenant_admin/index.html`, `instructor/index.html`, `super_admin/index.html`). The 6th file — `student/index.html` — is the v1 frozen baseline; per the preservation directive, the violation is documented as a known limitation in `student/README.md` rather than fixed. v1.4 student refresh should remove it.

**Risk — Non-FY26 palette colors in 2 specialized UI domains lacked documentation.** Code-block syntax highlighting (`--code-keyword: #ff7b72`, `--code-function: #79c0ff`, etc., GitHub-style) and the 9-step heatmap gradient (`--heat-1` through `--heat-9`) deliberately use extended palettes for clarity in their domains, but `README.md` didn't document them as scoped exceptions. Future implementers could mistakenly expand these to other surfaces. Added a "Documented palette extensions (intentional; out of FY26 scope)" subsection to `README.md` Color Palette section explicitly carving out the two domains and forbidding their expansion.

**Polish — `student/README.md` Known Limitations cross-link.** The Known Limitations section was thorough but only discoverable by scrolling past the Scenarios table. Added a parenthetical link from the Total scenarios row pointing to the section.

### Pass 5 → Pass 7 audit chain

| Pass | Result | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Pass 5 (adversarial) | 1 Blocker + 1 Risk + 1 Polish | All closed |
| **Pass 6** | **0 issues across 8 dimensions** | First clean post-fix |
| **Pass 7** | **0 issues across 9 verification checks** | Second consecutive clean |

### Editorial / documentation updates

- `README.md` — new Color Palette subsection "Documented palette extensions (intentional; out of FY26 scope)" with code-block + heatmap carve-outs and explicit "must NOT be expanded to other surfaces" guidance.
- `student/README.md` — known-limitations now lists 7 items (was 6); item #7 is the WCAG 2.2 AA §2.4.7 violation in the v1 frozen baseline. Total row links to the limitations section for early discoverability.
- 5 portal HTML files — heading `:focus-visible` override removed; replacement comment references WCAG 2.2 AA §2.4.7 and the capture pipeline's separate outline-suppression for screenshots.

### Browser walk-through note

The plan called for an interactive browser walk-through using Claude in Chrome MCP tools. Chrome MCP was not connected during this session (same as v4.5). Pass 5/6/7's PNG visual review + WebFetch of the live deploy covered visual verification. Interactive nav / theme-toggle / focus-ring behavior is consistent with the working code — the focus-ring fix is purely a CSS deletion (the existing `:focus-visible` rule already provides the correct 3px Bright Blue outline). No regressions expected on deploy.

### Verification

- Pass 6 + Pass 7 both 0 issues across all dimensions
- `git diff --stat student/index.html` returns **0 lines** (preservation directive intact through v4.5 → v4.6)
- All 5 modifiable portal files have heading focus-visible override removed (`grep "h[1-6]:focus-visible.*outline:.*none"` returns 0 single-line matches; multi-line override only remains in `student/index.html` which is correctly documented as a v1 limitation)
- Forbidden terms still 0 hits across deliverable surfaces
- Live deploy (https://brady-wgu.github.io/JFT_SDP/) currently shows v4.5 / 81 screens; will rebuild to v4.6 on merge

---

## v4.5 — 07 May 2026 — SOW + scenario compliance audit (2 consecutive clean passes)

Comprehensive 2-pass-clean compliance audit per Brady's directive. Every numbered SOW main-body section + every v1.3 scenario step verified against the storyboard. **Pass 3 and Pass 4 both reported 0 issues** — full SOW + scenario compliance achieved. `student/index.html` byte-identical to v4.2 baseline (preservation directive intact).

### Editorial scrub

- **Removed all internal-process terminology from deliverable surfaces.** 15 occurrences across `CHANGELOG.md` (4), `tenant_admin/index.html` (7), `tenant_admin/README.md` (4 in 1 row), `instructor/index.html` (2), and `super_admin/index.html` (2) replaced with plain SOW section notation (`§N.M`). Internal contract-management terms have no place in a JFT-facing or public artifact.
- **Drift fix in `super_admin/index.html` cost-spike screen 4** — copy referenced "New cohort + AI prompt expansion · Section 042 · Cohort 042 launch" (left over from a v4.0-era pattern). Reframed to "Enrollment surge in E010 + AI prompt expansion · 28 new learner launches under WGU's rolling-enrollment model" to match the User Profile's no-fixed-cohorts reality.
- **Drift fix in `presentation.html` + `presentation_dark.html` SC-ADD-03 step 4 + SC-ADD-04 step 4** narratives — same "Cohort summary" / "cohort 042 launch" copy reframed to "Course summary" / "enrollment surge in E010".
- **Persona-label drift fix in catalogs** — `presentation.html` + `presentation_dark.html` had two "Course Instructor" mentions that conflicted with the canonical "Instructor" role label. Removed (the User Profile equivalency context is documented in `instructor/README.md`; not needed in catalog narrative).

### Catalog completeness — `presentation.html` + `presentation_dark.html`

The v4.4 release added 6 new admin-portal screens but didn't extend the scenario-catalog narratives. v4.5 closes that gap:
- **SC-ADD-02** extended from 11 to 13 step entries — adds step 12 (Instructor Roster · screen 26) and step 13 (Subject Lifecycle · screen 27). Step 5 narrative expanded with a sentence about the inline "Recent versions" prompt-history panel.
- **SC-ADD-03** extended from 8 to 9 step entries — adds step 9 (Learner Search · screen 9). Step 3 narrative expanded with the new heatmap export CTAs (Course report PDF / CSV) and the name/email-search pivot.
- **SC-ADD-04** extended from 8 to 11 step entries — adds step 9 (Third-Party Integrations · screen 9), step 10 (Learner Remediation · screen 10), step 11 (Billing & Cost Centers · screen 11).
- Screen-map summary table updated: total now reads **81 screens** (was 75).
- Scenario-meta SOW-refs rows updated to add §10.4 (Tenant Admin), §7.12 + §7.14 (Instructor), §2.4 + §11.1 + §10.4 (Super Admin).
- Document Control table records a new "1.3+ / Current" row noting the v4.4 storyboard extensions on top of the catalog v1.3 baseline.
- Footer copy bumped "Storyboard v4.0" → "Storyboard v4.5" in both files.

### Verification — 2 consecutive 0-issue audit passes

Pass 1 (initial): 17 issues found (15 forbidden-term references, 2 catalog gaps for new screens, 1 drift cluster in super_admin) — all closed.
Pass 2 (post-fix): 1 issue found (2 stale "Course Instructor" mentions in catalogs) — fixed.
Pass 3 (post-fix): **0 issues**.
Pass 4 (independent re-verify): **0 issues** across all 7 verification categories (forbidden-term sweep, SOW main-body coverage, v1.3 scenario steps, catalog file integrity, student preservation, screenshot render quality, cross-portal canonical strings).

### Coverage summary

- ✓ All 15 SOW main-body sections (§§1–15) verified against at least one storyboard surface.
- ✓ All 28 v1.3 catalog scenario steps depicted across 41 admin-portal screens (tenant_admin 27 + instructor 9 + super_admin 11; less LRPS overlap = 41 unique admin screens). Plus 5 student scenarios (SC-ADD-01 acceptance rollup of v1.2) at 34/34 frozen baseline.
- ✓ 81-screen total: 34 student (frozen) + 27 tenant_admin + 9 instructor + 11 super_admin + 1 LRPS landing.
- ✓ 164 PNGs (74 light + 74 dark + 16 admin-portal extras for new screens) regenerated.
- ✓ `git diff --stat student/index.html` returns 0 lines.
- ✓ Cross-portal canonical strings (Sally / Charlie / Alice / Bob; E010 / E075 / E135; PDev; "Instructor" not "Course Instructor"; "rolling enrollment" not "Section 042 / Spring 2026 / Cohort") consistent across all 81 screens.

### Browser walk-through note

The plan called for an interactive browser walk-through using Claude in Chrome MCP tools. Chrome MCP was not connected during this session; Pass 1's PNG visual review covered visual rendering verification (all 6 new screens render cleanly in light + dark themes). Interactive nav / theme-toggle behavior is unchanged from the working v4.4 deployment, so the skipped walk-through is not gating compliance.

## v4.4 — 07 May 2026 — SOW gap fills against the contract

Eight contract-grounded gaps closed across the three admin portals. **Authority order baked in throughout: contract first, then User Profiles, then Mike's vernacular suggestions deprioritized to "out of scope unless SOW-grounded."** No changes to `student/index.html` (Brady's preservation directive — verified `git diff` shows 0 lines).

### Added — 6 new screens

- **`tenant_admin/` screen 26 — Instructor Roster & Course Assignment (G3, §2.5 + §10.8 RBAC).** 7-row instructor table including Course Instructors and Program Mentors (Charlie, Devon, Maya, Priya, Teagan, Noor, Logan/deactivated) with E010/E075/E135 course chips, active-learner counts (rolling enrollment), recent-assignment audit log, idle-warning badges, and bulk-import CTA. Explicit framing: LRPS owns account provisioning; this screen owns *course* assignment.
- **`tenant_admin/` screen 27 — Subject Lifecycle & Archival (G6, §2.5 module lifecycle + §10.4 audit logging).** Two-section layout: Active Subjects (E010 / E075 / E135 with deployed-version + learner-count + deactivate CTA) and Archived Subjects (E020 legacy / E099 pilot, FERPA-aligned 7-year retention, restore CTA). Right-rail "Deactivate Subject preview" panel with cutover date / retention policy / required-justification / audit warning.
- **`super_admin/` screen 9 — Third-Party Integrations (G8, §2.4 AI Orchestration + §2.5 system health).** Read-only Connected Services view: OpenRouter.ai (LLM gateway, replacing direct keys for OpenAI/Anthropic/Google), AWS (compute/data/networking), Datadog (APM/logs/synthetic), Entra ID (SSO), GitHub (CI/CD source), Slack (incident channel). Each card has a deep-link button to the vendor console. Explicit credential-management note: JFT owns rotation; rotate via Sev2 ticket, not in-portal.
- **`super_admin/` screen 10 — Learner Remediation (G1, Brady-clarified Global Admin scope).** LRPS owns account provisioning, so this screen is global-admin-only *coaching-state* remediation: per-objective score reset, reset all progress (subject or cross-subject), force re-diagnostic, pause access, view conversation log. Required justification field (audit-logged with actor/IP/before-after). Recent remediation events table. FERPA-scope clarification at the bottom: progress + score data only; account identity / LMS enrollment / grade-bearing assessments are out of scope.
- **`super_admin/` screen 11 — Billing & Cost Centers (G5, §11.1 hosting + support fee schedule + §6.6 token tracking).** Per-tenant cost allocation: 6-row table (PDev / SOB / SOH / SOE / SOIT / Pilot) with cost-center codes, owner emails, MTD spend, budget caps, EOM forecasts, status badges (PDev forecast to exceed). Spend-by-model breakdown via OpenRouter (Claude 56% / GPT-4o 28% / Gemini 16%). 4-row configurable budget-alert preferences.
- **`instructor/` screen 9 — Learner Search & Individual Lookup (G2, §7.10 + §7.12).** Reframed from Mike's "Gradebook" — the SDP is a practice tool, not a gradebook. Search by name / email / anonymized identifier across all 68 learners in Charlie's three courses, with course + status filters, sortable result table (Sally / Aisha / Daniel / Marcus / Priya / Jordan / Tasha / Riku as a representative cross-section), and per-row "Open profile" CTA that pivots to the existing drill-down. FERPA-scope note: Instructors only see learners in courses they instruct.

### Changed — small edits to existing surfaces

- **`tenant_admin/` screen 5 (AI Prompt Configuration)** — added a minimal "Recent versions" panel (G9) below the existing two-column form, showing the last 3 prompt edits with author, timestamp, and a one-line note. v3 marked as "live"; v2 + v1 read-only. Footnote explicitly defers diff view and rollback for JFT effort estimation. Per Brady: "minimal indication for JFT to see and push back if too hard."
- **`instructor/` screen 2 (Dashboard home)** — eyebrow chip "Active Section · Recommended next" → "Active Course · Recommended next". Stat caption "Spring 2026 · Sally and 27 others" → "28 active learners (rolling enrollment) · Sally + 27 others". "Roster" button → "Search learners" (deep-links to screen 9). E075/E135 cards: "Section" → "Course"; section numbers + Spring 2026 dropped.
- **`instructor/` screen 3 (Class heatmap)** — added export CTAs (Course report PDF / CSV) and a "Search by name / email" pivot to screen 9 (G10). Breadcrumb "E010 § 042" → "E010".
- **`instructor/` screen 5 (Sally profile)** — copy "E010 Section 042 · Cohort: Spring 2026" → "E010 · 28 active learners (rolling enrollment)". Breadcrumb sections updated.
- **`instructor/` screen 6 (Conversation logs)** — eyebrow "Cohort summary" → "Course summary".
- **`super_admin/` screen 2 (Portal home)** — Quick links extended from 4 cards to 8 (added Integrations / Learner Remediation / Billing / Audit Log).
- **Meta-bars** updated for `tenant_admin` (steps 26 + 27 added) and `super_admin` (steps 09 + 10 + 11 added) and `instructor` (step 09 added).
- **`capture_screens.py`** — PORTALS list updated; LRPS capture now scrolls the page so the live SDP rows + v4.3 "Not for student use" badges land in the hero shot (replacing the old top-of-page OEX-rows view that didn't communicate the page's purpose).

### Authority decisions documented in this release

Brady's directive: *"the contract rules everything. The User Profiles document is authoritative for persona naming and scope."* Items deprioritized accordingly:

- **Mike's "Course Instructor" rename** — REJECTED in v4.3, stays rejected. The User Profile + SOW §2.5 use `Instructor` as the contract-named user type.
- **Mike's "Admin" persona** — does not exist. The "global-level technical administrator with full cross-tenant access" *is* Super Admin (Bob) per the User Profile. Account-management functions land in `super_admin/`, not in a new persona and not in Tenant Admin (which is content-focused).
- **Account merge** — explicitly OUT per SOW §4 ("Manual creation or management of student accounts outside of LTI-based provisioning"). Not implemented.
- **AI score override authority for Instructors (G7)** — DROPPED. The SDP is a practice tool; coaching scores never feed academic records. There's no record to override.
- **Tenant Admin notification preferences (G4)** — DROPPED. The §9 Communication Plan is JFT→WGU rollout documentation, not runtime tenant-configurable alerting.
- **G11 (Tenant Onboarding Wizard) and G12 (Subject Usage Analytics heatmap)** — deferred per Brady direction.

### v4.4 size summary

- **6 new screens** (+ inline G9 panel + G10 heatmap CTAs)
- `tenant_admin` 25 → 27 · `instructor` 8 → 9 · `super_admin` 8 → 11
- **Total storyboard screens: 75 → 81**
- 164 PNGs regenerated (was 148)

## v4.3 — 07 May 2026 — v1.2 catalog cross-reference + LRPS admin labels

Catalog & narrative clarifications driven by a holistic re-read of the v1.2 student catalog (`JFT_SDP_MVP_Scenario_Catalog_v1_2_07APR2026.docx`) plus Mike's vernacular feedback. **No changes to `student/index.html`** — the v1 student screens are deliberately preserved as a baseline; all clarifications live in supporting narrative, READMEs, and the LRPS landing.

### Added

- **Top-level `README.md` — "Shared persona & course reference" section.** Codifies canonical strings used across all 5 surfaces: Sally (student), `E010` Foundations of Programming (Python), `§ 042` Spring 2026 section, `PDev` tenant, `WGUE010PythonAY2026` LMS course slug, the full Cicada v1 13-sub-section taxonomy, and the SC-ADD-04 cost-spike date. Drift across these strings was the most common source of cross-portal inconsistency risk; this block makes the canonical values single-sourced.
- **Top-level `README.md` Student section — "v1.2 catalog alignment" note.** Documents 100% catalog coverage (34/34 screens) and points readers at `presentation.html` for elaborated UX details and `student/README.md` for known v1 limitations.
- **`student/README.md` — "Screen 1 (zyBooks landing) is reference design only" callout.** Per the v1.2 catalog, the zyBooks course-page screen exists to contextualize the LTI launch; it is not part of the Coding Coach application or a JFT deliverable.
- **`student/README.md` — "v1 Known Limitations" section.** Six honest call-outs of what v1 does not depict (no real Python execution, no mid-task pause/resume, no error recovery flows, no re-assessment failure path, only 3 of 13 sub-sections detailed in narrative, educator feedback loop invisible from student storyboard alone). Candidates for a v1.4 student refresh.
- **`lrps/README.md` — "LMS → LRPS → LTI provisioning chain (student-facing flow)" section.** Documents how the student-facing Coding Coach link is provisioned: D&D registers SDP as an LRPS provider → places the link on the zyBooks E010 course page → Sally clicks → LRPS handles SSO + issues an LTI 1.3 launch carrying her WGU student ID, course context, and Learner role. Per-persona deep links (Tenant Admin / Instructor / Super Admin) use the same chain with admin role mappings. Basic LTI 1.3, not LTI Advantage.

### Changed

- **`presentation.html` and `presentation_dark.html` — four SC-MVP step narrative expansions (mirrored across both files):**
  - SC-MVP-01 step 3 (Diagnostic Q1) — describes the "Need a Hint?" interaction (scaffolding without giving away the answer) and the AI evaluation messaging (text-based LLM evaluation, same logic that drives later coaching feedback).
  - SC-MVP-02 step 10 (Difficulty Advances) — itemizes the three persistent session-stats fields (Sub-section / Tasks completed / Current difficulty) shown across coaching screens.
  - SC-MVP-03 step 7 (Fast-Track Results) — narrates *why* 12 of 13 sub-sections check off from the diagnostic while Functions & Modular Programming alone requires hands-on verification (the diagnostic question pool does not adequately sample module-level skills like `__name__ == "__main__"` guards).
  - SC-MVP-04 step 3 (Re-Assessment Q1) — calls out the "Re-Assessment · Welcome Back" badge prominence and frames the 2-question check as a retention check (not a fresh diagnostic) before coaching resumes at Sally's prior difficulty level.
- **`lrps/index.html` — "Not for student use" amber badges on the three live SDP admin rows** (SDP-TA / SDP-IN / SDP-SA). Material `block` icon + 10.5px uppercase label in the warning-tint amber. Theme-aware (lighter on dark theme). Mike's feedback: LRPS is admin-visible in some contexts where students might also browse the page, and the admin rows must never be confused for student-facing resources. The student row (SDP-ST) is unchanged.

### Verification

- `student/index.html` byte-identical to v4.2 — Brady's preservation directive honored. Verify with `git diff student/index.html` (expects 0 changes).
- LRPS screenshots regenerated to capture the new admin-row badges (light + dark themes).
- All four SC-MVP step narrative expansions parse correctly in both `presentation.html` and `presentation_dark.html`.

### Out of scope (this release)

- SOW Tier 1 gap fills — pending Brady's per-item green-light against the contract (`JFT_WGU_MSA_SOW_signed_05MAY2026.md`); planned for the next v4.x release.
- Mike's larger integration suggestions — pending Brady's green-light, *re-targeted against the authoritative User Profiles* (`JFT_SDP_User_Profiles_v1_2_30MAR2026.docx`):
  - **Gradebook** — fits within `instructor/` (Charlie). The User Profile lists "Access and export individual and group student performance data" and "Drill into individual student performance records" as primary Instructor goals; a Gradebook view that shows AI scores and supports flagging is consistent.
  - **Account-management operations** (merge / archive / username correction) — fits within `super_admin/` (Bob, the global-level cross-tenant administrator). The User Profile lists "Provisioning, deprovisioning, and manage tenant environments" and "Cross-tenant audit logs" as Super Admin responsibilities. **Not** a Tenant Admin function — that role is content-focused per the User Profile ("content and operations owners, not infrastructure owners").
  - **Mike's "Course Instructor" rename** — REJECTED. The User Profile and SOW Section 2.5 both use `Instructor` as the contract-named user type. Per Brady: contract and User Profiles are authoritative; colleague-vernacular suggestions yield to those documents.
- Modifications to `student/index.html` — deliberately preserved as v1 baseline; candidates for a future v1.4 student refresh.

## v4.2 — 07 May 2026 — v1.3 gap-coverage pass

Three-pass review against the v1.3 User Scenario Catalog identified three SOW-ref gaps. Filled to bring all 5 v1.3 scenarios to **100% workflow + SOW-ref coverage**. Two consecutive review passes confirmed zero remaining gaps.

### Added (3 fills)
- **`tenant_admin/` screen 24 — Tenant Settings: Branding & Customization (§7.9 Custom Branding).** Two-column tenant configuration with form + learner-facing preview. Form fields: tenant display name, logo upload (with current preview), primary accent color picker, custom domain (with DNS-verified status), favicon, footer copy. Preview pane shows a mock of how Sally sees the WGU PDev branding when she launches the Coding Coach.
- **`tenant_admin/` screen 25 — Tenant Settings: Team & Role-Based Access (§10.8 RBAC).** 5-row team table (Alice + Sam + Robin + Quinn + pending Kit invite) with Owner / Editor / Viewer role badges. Recent role-change audit log. 10-row permissions matrix showing what each role can do. Multi-tenant isolation alert.
- **`super_admin/` screen 6 — Compliance Report enhancement (§10.1 FERPA Compliance).** Added a FERPA privacy compliance section above the existing TLS service-by-service table. 4 FERPA KPI gauges (100% staff training / 7-yr audit retention / 3-yr inactive learner data retention / N/A parental notification — adult learners only). 6-row FERPA control table referencing 34 CFR §§99.10 / 99.31 / 99.32 / 99.37 plus WGU policies 8.2 and 8.4. Eyebrow updated to "Encryption + Privacy Audit · §10.7 · §10.1."

### Changed
- `tenant_admin/` portal home (screen 2) gains a "Tenant Settings" button alongside the existing New Subject + Cross-Subject Analytics CTAs.
- Meta-bar SC-ADD-02 navigation extended from 9 buttons to 11 (steps 10/11 link to screens 24/25).
- `tenant_admin` `TOTAL_SCREENS` bumped 23 → 25.
- `capture_screens.py` PORTALS list extends `sc-add-02` screen ids with `[24, 25]` so the pipeline captures the new screens.
- `presentation.html` and `presentation_dark.html` extended with new SC-ADD-02 step 10 + 11 entries, SC-ADD-04 step 6 description enriched with FERPA, screen-map summary updated (SC-ADD-02 row 9 → 11; total 73 → 75).
- README, per-persona READMEs, and version badges updated to reflect 75-screen total.

### Coverage verification

Pass 2 + Pass 3 (both clean): every workflow sentence and every SOW reference across SC-ADD-02 through SC-ADD-06 is now visually depicted in the storyboard. Mapping table of SOW refs to screens lives in each persona's README.

---

## v4.1 — 07 May 2026 — Repo restructure

Reorganization-only release. No new scenarios or screen content.

### Changed
- **Repo renamed** `brady-wgu/JFT_SDP_MVP` → `brady-wgu/JFT_SDP`. The MVP suffix no longer reflects scope (storyboard now spans 4 personas, not just the v1.2 MVP).
- **Per-persona subdirectories.** Each portal moved into its own folder with its own `index.html`, `README.md`, `screenshots/`, and `screenshots_dark/`:
  - `index.html` → `student/index.html`
  - `tenant_admin.html` → `tenant_admin/index.html`
  - `instructor.html` → `instructor/index.html`
  - `super_admin.html` → `super_admin/index.html`
  - `lrps.html` → `lrps/index.html`
  - All 148 PNGs distributed into the corresponding per-persona screenshot directories.
- **`index.html` at root is now a portal-selector landing page** with cards for every surface (LRPS, Student, Tenant Admin, Instructor, Super Admin, Catalog) and 4 hero stats.
- **`README.md` rewritten** organized by user group / persona. The MVP-specific language now lives in the Student section. Each persona section covers scope, scenarios, screens, and links into the persona's subdirectory README.
- **Each persona subdirectory has its own README** — short summary, scenario IDs, screen count, embedded hero screenshot, links back to root.
- **Catalog screenshot paths updated** in `presentation.html` / `presentation_dark.html` to reference the new per-persona directories (146 total path rewrites across both files).
- **`capture_screens.py` rewritten** to derive output paths from each portal's HTML location — outputs now land in `{persona}/screenshots/` and `{persona}/screenshots_dark/`.
- **`CHANGELOG.md` extracted from README** so the README can stay current without bloating.
- **`.gitignore` added** for `.claude/`, OS junk, Python caches, node_modules.

### URL changes (post-rename, GitHub Pages auto-redirects for ~1 month)

## v4.0 — 07 May 2026 — Full v1.3 admin portal coverage

Major release adding the three v1.3 admin portals (Tenant Admin, Instructor, Super Admin) and the LRPS landing — bringing the storyboard from one persona (Sally) to four.

### Added
- **Tenant Admin Portal** (`tenant_admin/`) — Alice. 23 screens covering SC-ADD-02 (Portal & Course Configuration), SC-ADD-05 (Data Portability), SC-ADD-06 (Critical Incident Response & SLA Verification). New components: 5-step CI/CD Stepper, REST API console with method/endpoint/params, JSON syntax-highlighted code blocks, JFT CSM chat thread, SLA gauge dashboard.
- **Instructor Dashboard** (`instructor/`) — Charlie. 8 screens covering SC-ADD-03 (At-Risk Intervention). New components: CSS-grid student-competency heatmap (15 learners × 4 competencies, 9-step color scale), per-objective score pills, AI coaching transcript with feedback panels, Audit Trail event log with sha256 hashes.
- **Super Admin Portal** (`super_admin/`) — Bob. 8 screens covering SC-ADD-04 (Governance & Cost Audit). New components: cross-tenant overview gauges, 30-bar daily cost-spike chart, per-tenant utilization meters, TLS 1.3 compliance report, geo-redundancy region cards, cross-tenant audit log feed.
- **LRPS Landing** (`lrps/`) — recreation of WGU's internal Learning Resource Provisioning System. Originally faithful to the legacy enterprise aesthetic; restyled with the SDP Design System v1.2 in commit `e735361`. Each persona's secret LRPS deep link maps to a clickable provider row.
- **Real WGU FY26 Corporation logos** in `assets/`. Theme-aware swap: Full-Color Reverse on light theme, White on dark theme. Wordmark text removed (Brady's branding rule).
- **Per-persona LRPS deep links** modeled in each portal's screen 1 (SSO landing → role mapping).

### Changed
- **README bumped to v4.0**. Pages table extended; scenarios split into v1.2 (Sally) and v1.3 (Alice / Charlie / Bob) groups; new components enumerated.
- **`presentation.html` / `presentation_dark.html`** extended with full SC-ADD walkthroughs for SC-ADD-02 through SC-ADD-06 (39 new annotated steps each, ~250 lines added per file). Navbar / TOC / Document Control updated to cover all 9 scenarios.
- **`capture_screens.py` rewritten** to capture all 5 portals × 2 themes (148 PNGs total) with per-theme localStorage init.

### Notes
- SC-ADD-01 (acceptance rollup of v1.2 MVP) is in progress separately, no new scope. Mentioned in catalog but no new screens.
- LRPS layout fixed in `8704b3b` to eliminate a large left gutter at wide viewports (container max-width bumped 1300 → 1920px, side padding tightened, `minmax(0, 1fr)` added to the shell grid).

---

## v3.1 — 30 Apr 2026 — v1.2 catalog alignment

Polish release for the v1.2 student MVP storyboard.

### Added
- `presentation_dark.html` — dark-theme catalog with all 34 dark-theme screenshots.
- Skip navigation links, `<main>` landmark, contentinfo footer, focus indicators, responsive breakpoints, touch-target sizing, contrast-ratio fixes.

### Changed
- **zyBooks landing page** replaces the mock WGU Student Portal LMS page (Screen 01) across all four scenarios. "Coding Coach" CTA placed next to the Competencies section as the new entry point.
- **Sequential screen numbering** — all 34 screens renumbered sequentially (01–08 SC-MVP-01, 09–19 SC-MVP-02, 20–28 SC-MVP-03, 29–34 SC-MVP-04). Admin bar shows true screen numbers.
- **Presentation text sync** — `presentation.html` / `presentation_dark.html` aligned with v1.2 Scenario Catalog (07 Apr 2026), including expanded LRPS descriptions per WGU LRPS team review.
- **Design system audit** — 271 fixes across `index.html` and `presentation.html` for WCAG 2.2 AA compliance, FY26 color palette alignment, typography scale enforcement, 8-point spacing grid.
- **FY26 palette reconciliation** — `--pgn-*` tokens updated from SDP Figma values to FY26 authoritative values.
- **Light-mode code blocks** — white background with SDP palette syntax highlighting; dark mode retains `#0d1117`.
- All 68 screenshots (34 light + 34 dark) recaptured at 1440×900 with sequential filenames matching new screen IDs.

### Removed
- "Screen X of Y" navigation bar from all screens.

### Fixed
- `:focus-visible` outline on headings after programmatic focus suppressed.

---

## v3.0 — 30 Mar 2026 — Initial MVP storyboard

First complete v1.2 MVP storyboard release. 34 screens across the 4 student scenarios (SC-MVP-01 through SC-MVP-04). Single-page interactive prototype + scrollable presentation catalog. Built with Claude Code on the SDP Design System v1.2.

---

*Earlier internal iterations (v1.x, v2.x) are not included in this changelog.*
